# React E-commerce Test

## Product Card UI Demo

This project includes a modern, responsive Product Card component that displays product image, name, price, variant options, and an Add to Cart button. If a product is out of stock, the button is disabled or replaced with an "Out of Stock" label.

**Layout Approach:**
The Product Card UI uses a CSS grid layout for the product listing, ensuring all cards are evenly spaced and aligned. Each card features a fixed-height image area, clean typography, and a clear call-to-action, following modern e-commerce design best practices.

**Responsiveness:**
The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes using CSS grid and media queries. Product cards and images resize appropriately for mobile, tablet, and desktop, maintaining usability and visual appeal across devices.
