# React E-commerce Test

## Product Card UI Demo

This project features a modern, responsive Product Card component designed for scalable e-commerce applications. Each card presents a product image, name, price, variant selector, and an Add to Cart button, with clear feedback for out-of-stock items.

**Layout & UI/UX:**
- Product cards are arranged in a CSS grid, ensuring consistent alignment and spacing across all viewports.
- Each card maintains a fixed image area, clean typography, and a prominent call-to-action, adhering to contemporary e-commerce design standards.

**Responsiveness:**
- The interface is fully responsive, leveraging CSS grid and media queries to deliver an optimal experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Product cards and images scale fluidly, preserving usability and visual hierarchy at any screen size.

**Professional React Engineering:**
- The `ProductCard` component is modular, maintainable, and optimized for performance using `useMemo` to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- PropTypes enforce type safety and serve as in-code documentation for component contracts.
- UI subcomponents (e.g., the wishlist button) are extracted for clarity, reusability, and separation of concerns.
- Event handlers and business logic are clearly named and encapsulated, supporting easy extension and debugging.
